# README Generator

  ## Description:
  The purpose of this project was to create a command-line application that would create a README file based on user input. I wanted to create this project to demonstrate how much information can be both added and created from a user's command line. I was given some starter code in the generateMarkdown file. After that, I created a gitignore file, installed inquirer, and used several other packages to establish the necessary framework for optimal functionality. Afterward, I created a question array and many function across my two main Javascript files. In addition to learning more and more about these practices, I also learned a little bit about licenses. In short, the main goal of this project was to exhibit, practice, and present a project that would enable a user to create a file from the command line. In this case, it was a README file. 


  ## Technology Used:
  1. Javascript
  2. node
  3. Inquirer
